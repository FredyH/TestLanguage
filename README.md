# TestLanguage
A small language created mainly for fun to see what I can do with it. The goal is to create a functional language with generics and possibly dependent types.
That is still very far away though.

Currently the language targets the JVM but it should not be too hard to also let it target other architectures.

It was mainly inspired by Haskell (data syntax) and Scala (most other syntax).

It is still in its very early stages and can't really be used yet, a few examples can be found in the examples folder though.
